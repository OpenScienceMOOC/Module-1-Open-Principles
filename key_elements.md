### Tasks:

* Get an [ORCID](orcid.org) account, and fill out your profile. This is a unique identifier for you as a researcher.

* Get a [Publons](https://publons.com/home/) account, integrate with your new ORCID, and valorise your reviewer effort!

* Get an [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/) account, and integrate with ORCID, showcase your output (not just publications)!

* Write a summary about Open Access efforts either on your research discipline and/or in your country. If you have a website or blog, post it there.

    * Were the data for this easy to acquire? Which sources did you use?

* Look at the status of Open Science in your research group or lab. Make a note of who is doing what. What could be improved?

* Define clearly what Open Science means to you. Have a conversation about it with a colleague. Then, find someone from a different country, and have another conversation about Open Science. 

* Find out the policies are in your department or institute regarding:

    * Career progression and assessment.

    * Publishing and Open Access.

    * Data sharing.

    * Intellectual Property (IP).

* Identify any disciplinary repositories either for research articles or data.
